I bought 8 different admin templates recently and all of them had some good features, but were always missing stuff that you only realise after purchase. I've migrated my site to this template and have yet to find anything missing or lacking! Plus, the online documentation is really easy to use and access and very comprehensive! Well done guys and thank you! ",
